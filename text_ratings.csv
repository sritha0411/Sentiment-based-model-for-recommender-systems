Yeah you're impressing douchey 14 year olds who waste their lives on YouTube but to the real world you and your fucktard brother are nothing more than a pair of over privileged, white privileged toddlers. Grow the fuck up man. You think this will be your life forever. One day you're going to face the real world and realize you can't just jump around and scream your way to a real job.

cLdxuaxaQwc,Love you Pewdiepie don't apologize your fine,0,5
cLdxuaxaQwc,"I am seeing so much idiocy and lack of self awareness in these comments. Let me hit you all with some knowledge: the N word is not okay to say because it has body counts and a huge amount of human suffering attached to it. The word goes back to slave owning days, same as the N word with no hard r. Black folks can say the word because it is theirs to reclaim. I'm a person of color and that word is not in my vocabulary. Why? Because I'm not black, and I'm aware of the oppression tied to this word. I'm also not a piss baby arguing why I should be able to use such a gross word because again, this word is not mine to reclaim. So yeah, it's fine when all these black rappers use the word because it's a part of their personal history. As a grown ass woman I am still in disbelief that people can't have a pinch of empathy for their fellow human beings. If you're not black, you are irrelevant in the conversation of whether you can say the n word. You can't, bottom line, and if you're still arguing your right to say it, well then I have news for you: you're a racist.",0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,Pewds we are all behind you. This is just another attack on your character. We love you,0,4
cLdxuaxaQwc,You're telling me that you're not perfect and sometimes you fuck up? \nThat's wired..,0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,Everybody says that when u play call of duty and other games it's immature but can be over looked by great people it takes someone low to sit and fight about it it's life man,0,4
cLdxuaxaQwc,Never apologise to the regressives,0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,"dont be sorry pewds, EVERYBODY says something  bad everyday, but your a public person and says this ONE time and get fukin news all over the world talking about it.. jeeezyys, keep on doing what your doing niggah",0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,Other streamers do the same thing and don't apologize. Here is a prime example of a truly moral person he tries so hard even censors himself to try and be a good example but he makes one tiny mistake and they attack him.  I saw an example where a teachers writes the time tables for 9 he starts by writing 9x1=10 then writes the rest right. The kids make fun because he got one wrong but fail to acknowledge that the rest are correct it goes to show people will quickly make fun of your mistakes but ignore your accomplishments. Keep doing what you're doing pewds you truly are an inspiration,0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,PROCEED WITH CAUTION: \nThis comment section will give you stage 4 cancer immediately.,0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,this isn't a bad thing... shit happens,0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,"I forgot that pewdiepie's fandom is a majority white people 😒.\n IF 👏 YOU'RE 👏 WHITE 👏 DONT 👏 TELL 👏 POC 👏 HOW 👏 THEY 👏 SHOULD 👏 FEEL 👏. Our ancestors paid for that word with their own blood, so poc today can use it how ever we want. You cannot tell us how we should feel. Y'all are disgusting for backing up your problematic fave and I'm pretty sure he did this before. Pewdiepie is canceled.",0,4
cLdxuaxaQwc,And this could in all honestly become a good thing for you. You sit on a platform where you could really educate people especially when so many of your fans seem to think it's okay to be said. Really learn about the history of the word and come back to us if you can because you could really help educate people and that's powerful.,1,5
cLdxuaxaQwc,What the hell is wrong with everyone who's talking badly about him he said the word by accident it's ok pewdiepie you're super cool we all love you the people who are here and supporting you😊❤️,0,5
cLdxuaxaQwc,"OK guys i get that the word was once used as a demeaning term and that the history of that word will never change, yes pewds fucked up but still it quite obviously wasn't his intention to use the word in a racist way. And those people overreacting are making it easier for toxic media influencers  to fuck every single content creator because they are blowing this out of proportion, pewds is not a racist.",0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,pewdiepie had nothing to be sorry about.  everybody who is mad at him need to get their head out of their ass and get over themselves.  or maybe when a black person makes an offensive remark about a white person i should call them racist and see how they like it.  turn about is fair play.,0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,I think other YouTube's who are hatting at him are just jealous that he is bigger than them. I think yes it was wronge for him to say it but common give this guy a break ok I have heard this word said by black people daily if they can say it why can't white people why so sensitive. I am Indian and have heard Sooo much rasisum from every body including black and white people. This is outrageous I am pissed and not happy u can clearly see he was hyped up at the time when he said this can't u actually just support him and understand that he is a human as well,0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,"Oh no you're famous so theyre take this outta proportion, keemstar and idubbz didnt get attacked by media just because theyre smaller",0,3
cLdxuaxaQwc,Y'all will forgive him for anything lol,0,5
cLdxuaxaQwc,i think its funny how he said one word and all of the sudden its the end of the world i get it words hurt but you all need to grow up honestly because i can say this the fact that you get offended by a word is dissapointing like seriously theres so much worse one youtube but no one does anything about that grow up!! and at least he had the decency to own up to what you did he said this to everyone in the entire world lets you get on camara and apologize infront of millions of people i bet you cant do it..,0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,"I am not angry at you at all.  And you shouldn't have to apologize.  The way I see it, if it's such a bad word then NO ONE should be using it.  Not just white people.  I support you Pewds!",0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,"HUMANS MAKE MISTAKES\n\nIF YOU HAVENT MADE THEM, YOU ARENT HUMAN.",0,2
cLdxuaxaQwc,i am convinced a large percentage of PewDiePie's audience are 12 year old white boys who think they are edgy by saying the N word.,0,4
cLdxuaxaQwc,"I don't see it as racist, but rather as an accident",0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,I like how when other people say these things its fine but when a famous person says this everyone loses their heads,0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,People mad because he said the n word!? He said it by accident cause everyone does it,0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,"Its just a word, calm down",0,4
cLdxuaxaQwc,"lets be honest here guys, we all have let the word slip before... cmon now lol, we are confronted with the word on tv, music, shows, friends, cmon now we have all let it slip atleast once....  lets not front",0,5
cLdxuaxaQwc,To the people saying that since black people say it why does it matter if another race says it this is one of many reasons why our society is shit now. It doesn't matter if black says it that doesn't justify other groups using the term shit like that doesn't just slip out that's the worst word you can think of ? It's scary how dumb a lot of people are in these comments we've got a lot of work to do America. Some of your reasoning validation his reasoning for using the word is ridiculous. #SMD,0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,"So humble! It's ok Pewds, u didn't mean to cause the drama that crowds try to create. U are a good example to your fans.",0,5
cLdxuaxaQwc,👈 watch by clicking here people's are entertaining,1,4
cLdxuaxaQwc,"Listen listen, it's not up to white people to judge or criticize you for what you said, the word you said it's a offensive slang to black people if anyone has the right to be offended is them. So, please , people on the comments, stop saying it's just a word or I feel offended for them . Let them say what they think about what happened.",0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,What did he say??,0,2
cLdxuaxaQwc,"Honestly, who is not racist (in their own way) nowadays? Even ppl make jokes of asian having small eyes ...it's common and no it doesnt affect me LOL PLUS HE DIDNT SAY IT OWN PURPOSE ! IF HE REALLY MEANT IT, WHY WOULD HE SAY SORRY :/",0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,If your not black you have no right to say that word point blank period,0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,I'm white ok I don't know if it really is offensive at all. BUT HOW THE FUCK DOES HIM SAYING THIS AFFECT YOU AT ALL. He didn't say anything about someone trying to be mean to them. Y'all need to chill.,0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,Sticks and Stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me,0,5
cLdxuaxaQwc,Don't apologize. Political correctness is the newspeak word for leftist censorship.  All these media outlets just trying to bring you down solely because you seem to be somewhat right winged. The fucking Wall Street Journal tried the same thing few months ago and they failed lmao,0,3
cLdxuaxaQwc,I forgive you but man i can you blame people for saying the n word we say it ourselves,0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,Social justice warriors need to chill,0,5
cLdxuaxaQwc,"As a Black American, I don't think it's that big of a deal. I haven't even seen the clip but from what I've heard and from what I know about Pewds from watching him for years, I can conclude it wasn't meant to be offensive. Lots of the time the word is used now (or its variants), it's not meant to be racist or worth getting offended over. Although, I don't get why people have this weird obsession with saying it. While context does matter, regardless, it's a word with a shitty history and unnecessary to use. When people have a fixation with the word it weirds me out and makes me think they're closet racists. Do people think it's edgy or something? (I'm talking primarily about nigger, not nigga because that word has a totally different connotation)",0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,Saying Nigga isn't even bad it's only bad if you say it in a hateful way to black people ALL THE CRY BABIES and immature people stop going at him I guarantee youse you wouldn't say it to idubbz or others but because it's pewdiepie you think you have the right to go full force at him Yet I can see were people are coming from because pewdiepie did start the biggest ad crisis on any platform ever he has to much pressure on  him that's my speech down 😂😂 btw I do like idubbz it was just an example,0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,"say the N word is not alright at all, but people are overreacting waaaaay too much",0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,Idubbbz says niggerfaggot in like every single video a year ago and it's hilarious. Everyone's such a boner. Love you Felix,0,5
cLdxuaxaQwc,"If u are really sorry, donate money to africa that you got from making this video.",0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,"Poods, irrespective of your intentions (which I genuinely believe are pure and not hateful), you are a public face and voice and what you say and do influences others greatly. It's really disappointing to see that you still struggle to really respect the influence you have on YouTube and to your 57 million audience. I hope you wake the fuck up and stop this shit because you're a good, entertaining guy who really is and should be better than this. I hope you turn things around bro. Be more woke.",0,5
cLdxuaxaQwc,It's okay man👌👌,0,5
cLdxuaxaQwc,"Weird, my thumbs up doesn't stay. Could it be corrupted YouTube again?",0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,"The day nobody cares about the word is the day it loses its power over people. Don't try to tell me that I'm only saying this because I don't UNDERSTAND. I DO. People have been slaughtered before, Countries have been Defiled AND ENSLAVED.. USED AS PROSTITUTES. NOT ONLY YOU... WHY DO I FEEL LIKE YOU GUYS ARE LETTING THIS N WORD STILL ENSLAVE YOU?",0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,Who gives a Shit .,0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,"THERE ARE PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM HURRICANES AND YET Y'ALLZ ARE WORRIED ABOUT SOME CRACKA WITH A POTTY MOUTH???\n\nSincerely, your friendly neighborhood Beaner.",0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,"honestly I don't care I won't let the word overpower me, I always will care about you pewdie!",0,5
cLdxuaxaQwc,say the word cracker.. journos wont care because theres a huge double standard and they hate white people!,0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,This guy's face screams 'I'm gonna kill myself'. He seems to have lost all zest for life.,0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,Blacks folks say that shit with every sentence and when whitey says it on accident without disrespectful thoughts the whole world turns.,0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,It's ok Felix.,0,4
cLdxuaxaQwc,"I think it is okay, you are sorry about that and it is done. Strange is, that we have here 2 kind of people. 1 which can say this word with N and nothing happen und the other people where everybody get insane. Just think of it.",0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,Power is the disease.  Care is the cure.  Keep caring for yourself and others as best as you can.  This is life.,0,5

cLdxuaxaQwc,People in the coments you are stupid hes an adult its not a mastake he should know not to say it stop defending him all the time,0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,Y'all are stupid,0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,I bet you only 10% of the people getting triggered by him saying the n word are actually black.,0,2
cLdxuaxaQwc,Hey Felix who care? The context is what matters. We know you are not a racist. Don't feed into these stupid narratives.,0,4
cLdxuaxaQwc,"Hi Felix. As an newly subscriber and a fan, I didn't see the bit your apologizing for on your channel but heard the douchebag Sargon of Akkad (not a fan) mentioned it on his channel, where he's clearly stating that it's more then ok to use that particular word if one is not a racist and actually said it multiple times. You clarly have more integrity and a higher moral character then he has and as a Albanien-Swed, am verry proud of you for apologizing. Big UP Brah!",0,5
cLdxuaxaQwc,Ive said some hateful shit while playing video games and i tend to rage to and in that rage i probably shouldn't have said some stuff that i did but idgaf,0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,"I defended pewds the last racist thing he did. Pewds isn't racist, that's just his inappropriate, dark humor. There's no need to be sensitive, but if you're accidentally racist on several occasions it's not an accident and you're actually racist. I've never ever said the n word, because from a white person that's a terribly hurtful word, and with the black family members that I have, I would never want my young cousins to hear the word that came out of this mans mouth, especially since he's an influencer. Now I'm going to be hearing it more, and then hear well pewdiepie said it, so can I. It's not okay, and it's not something you say in the heat of the moment, it only slips out if you frequently say it. I think I gotta give up on defending this. I've been subscribed for like 6 years. And it's time to say farewell.",0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,Pewdiepie puts up a sorry video for saying the N word.\n\n90% of the comments are people typing it.,0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,"You are basically the face of YouTube. For someone who has woken up from a coma since before YouTube was around you'd be the first thing they'd know about YouTube. I know you have all this pressure under your shoulders because if you say anything wrong, it would be like the YouTube logo walked on stage and said: Fuck off! \n\nIt's hard to control how you are and speak, I know it, and I feel bad for you. You didn't have to apologize, as you said nigger to a yellow fucking blob, but you did.",0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,All these people that are saying you should say what ever you want are also trump supporters.,0,4
cLdxuaxaQwc,Pewd you don't have anything to apologize for... it's just a word,0,4
cLdxuaxaQwc,"Thank you for apologizing pewds, i haven't lost respect for you",0,4
cLdxuaxaQwc,Sh*t happens carry on,0,2
cLdxuaxaQwc,Dude it's just a word. Maybe ppl shouldn't be getting so butt hurt to be honest.,0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,It's not like he said Voldemort. Ain't no evil wizards gonna come out if you say the n word,0,1
cLdxuaxaQwc,lol its just a word,0,4
cLdxuaxaQwc,If a black american says the n word it's called slang. If a black american can call us white people or typical white girls it's called fun. But if a white person says the n word he's a racist. K den,0,1

WYYvHb03Eog,"The phone itself looks pretty great but it isn't worth the $1,000. I'd say wait a while before buying it so the price can lower. By March next year it's probably gonna be the same price as the IPhone 7 is now.",0,2

WYYvHb03Eog,"If Apple never named their iPhones with an s and numbered it like Air Jordan shoes every year, the iPhone X would have been released last year. Now after releasing 14 different iPhone models, it's confusing having an 8 and 10 but no 9.\n\nThis is what Apple should have done without s naming.. \n\n2007 - iPhone\n2008 - iPhone II instead of 3G\n2009 - iPhone III instead of 3Gs\n2010 - iPhone IV \n2011 - iPhone V instead of 4s\n2012 - iPhone VI instead of 5\n2013 - iPhone VII instead of 5s\n2014 - iPhone VIII instead of 6\n2015 - iPhone IX instead of 6s\n2016 - iPhone X instead of 7\n2017 - iPhone XI instead of 8 & X\n\nOnly the first iPhone and iPhone 4 were named properly.

_HTXMhKWqnA,...From a emoji *uses the poop emoji* this is the best shit from the new iPhone though.\ndude...,0,4
_HTXMhKWqnA,brb* going to whore myself for this phone,1,1
_HTXMhKWqnA,I think people won't complain about the headphone jack if Apple Ships their iPhones with wireless earbuds.,0,4
_HTXMhKWqnA,What if u just show a picture of the iPhone owner's face to unlock the phone lolol,0,2
_HTXMhKWqnA,I liked the what does the fox say joke,0,5
_HTXMhKWqnA,"There is no 9, because 7 ate 9! Okay I'll go now....",1,1
_HTXMhKWqnA,how can you take a screenshot ??,0,2
_HTXMhKWqnA,That gesture reminds me of the BlackBerry 10 OS,0,2
_HTXMhKWqnA,Specs are fine but imo..... Hate the design for the hell of everything!,0,1
_HTXMhKWqnA,$1000 for a phone?!?! WTF. then iPhone XI will come out in six months but this time it will be larger. geez,0,1
_HTXMhKWqnA,Talking shit emoji! That is classic! Thank you Apple engineers for making it real,0,1
_HTXMhKWqnA,Why can't anyone build a phone without camera bumps?,0,2
_HTXMhKWqnA,No reason to buy it,1,1
_HTXMhKWqnA,"iPhone 10. If you're going to use numerals for your prior devices numerals it is. Now if they had revealed the iPhone VIII and iPhone VIII+, then I would use X as in x-ray. Either way, I won't be going to a phone that only allows facials for biometrics.",0,2
_HTXMhKWqnA,"This looks cool enough, but i prefer the older style of iphones more, so i'll probably stick to iphone 8",0,4
_HTXMhKWqnA,Does it come up with preloaded 4k porn??,0,2
_HTXMhKWqnA,Gonna buy the iphone X *ASAP* ! It got animated emojis guys like wtf you want more ?,0,1
_HTXMhKWqnA,Did the idea of having a  microsd never crossed apples mind??!? And why isn't there a headphones jack !!!!face Id is nice but why remove the touch Id!????,0,5
_HTXMhKWqnA,"I don't get it. Since it has 3D Touch, why didn't Apple incorporate a hard press at the bottom of the screen to go home? Swipe seems less intuitive.",0,1
_HTXMhKWqnA,Why dont TMobile sell google phones? Ive seen them get the best ratings for cameras etc but why arent they more mainstream?,0,4
_HTXMhKWqnA,"as a left handed iPhone user, I´m wondering, if you can go to the Control Center by swiping from the left top corner, too? :/",0,1
_HTXMhKWqnA,"*I think the iPhoneX is beautiful, can't wait to get my hands on one. Also interested to see what case companies do for iPhoneX phone cases. 🤔*",0,5
_HTXMhKWqnA,Literally looks like a bad version of the s8 mixed in with some bad Chinese Android knockoffs.,0,1
_HTXMhKWqnA,New phones rolling out every year with minor design changes to keep hype going and getting more expensive. Over-marketing strategy.,0,2
_HTXMhKWqnA,"How will face id help chinese unlock the fone, they all look the same😂😝",0,5
_HTXMhKWqnA,This is a really nice phone but the price makes it hard to justify against something like the Galaxy S8 or Essential phone,0,5
_HTXMhKWqnA,"If you drop these phones, you're lucky if both glass panels don't shatter simultaneously...screen and back. But iPhone buyers have enough money anyway...so it hits no beggars. lol",0,1
_HTXMhKWqnA,Hmm can't say I'm too into the look of this phone... I think I'm gonna go with the LG V30 this year.,0,2
_HTXMhKWqnA,hahhaha you fool...ass hole ...there is nothing new,0,2
_HTXMhKWqnA,"Eehhhhhhh, its a disappointment. The s8 and note 8 are miles ahead.",0,1
_HTXMhKWqnA,Is it just me or does the iPhone X frame look chunkier compared to the S8+?,0,2
_HTXMhKWqnA,"Beautiful design but if I'm going for anything, it will be keeping my 6s and getting the Apple Watch with cellular",0,4
_HTXMhKWqnA,"People complaining about the notch are imbeciles. How else were they supposed to go full screen and still fit the speaker grille, sensors & front camera in there? iPhone X is gorgeous, imo.",0,5
_HTXMhKWqnA,they took gesture tech from blackberry 10 phones. BB was really good. Missing it.,0,4
_HTXMhKWqnA,"Really ? You don't have any complaints right off the bat? That's kinda sad, I saw you as a reliable source of information.",0,1
_HTXMhKWqnA,I will not be wearing a case with iPhone X,0,2
_HTXMhKWqnA,I was really curious about that iPhone 9 thing too. Apparently it's the iPhone X because it's the ten year anniversary,0,4
_HTXMhKWqnA,Hats off for the owners of Apple for all the money they are going to make with their new overpriced gadgets.,0,2
_HTXMhKWqnA,*Does anyone thinks this is a complete waste of money?*,0,1
_HTXMhKWqnA,There are some A holes that judging something they can’t afford stupid kids down there,0,1
_HTXMhKWqnA,samsung alredy have all these new features,0,2
_HTXMhKWqnA,Intro sounds like it belongs in Splatoon. :P,0,5
_HTXMhKWqnA,"Dumbest phone, just buy the any iphone since the 6. They are all basically the same thing.",0,1
_HTXMhKWqnA,When are they gonna be on sell ??,0,2
_HTXMhKWqnA,Do they have to pay some sort of fee to touch and use the phones??,0,1
_HTXMhKWqnA,"I have Apple products but I can’t justify paying $1,000 for this phone. Seems like they need to bring in people who are more inventive.",0,5
_HTXMhKWqnA,My galaxy S8 is still better. Switching to android from Apple has been my best decision this year.,0,5
_HTXMhKWqnA,"Dont you dare call it iphone x, accidentally says iphone x 😂😂",0,5
_HTXMhKWqnA,It's cool but not a 1000 bucks cool,0,5
_HTXMhKWqnA,How do you turn the phone off if holding down the button activates Siri?,0,2
_HTXMhKWqnA,Does this thing know how to suck a dick?,0,1
_HTXMhKWqnA,EVERYONE holds their phone by the sides....WHY THE FUCK is the power button on the side instead of the top to prevent accidental pressing and having to unlock the phone AGAIN!?!?!?!   (super major gripe with every phone out there....designers are morons),0,1
_HTXMhKWqnA,I worry about certain games that require you to swipe up from the bottom of the screen to play and that might constantly trigger the back to home screen function.,0,4
_HTXMhKWqnA,yay i can afford a 4s now,0,5
_HTXMhKWqnA,the iPhone 8... skips to 10...\nWindows 8... also skips to 10...\n;),0,2
_HTXMhKWqnA,Hell man I'm tripping on a 1000 bucks really,0,1
_HTXMhKWqnA,"I prefer iPhone 8 over 10, ‘cause iPhone 10 looks like one of those android phones with a similar design. iPhone 8 looks more of a iPhone instead of 10.",1,4
_HTXMhKWqnA,How do you power it off if the power button is now a Siri button?,1,2
_HTXMhKWqnA,Finally i will be able to buy iPhone SE,1,2
_HTXMhKWqnA,Everyone just getting all their new Apple stuff while i still cant afford the actual fruit smh -_-,1,1

We don't mind if you are in the hallway, but if you push the door like a creep and take a picture? We have a problem.

Then again we were facing with more disasters and floods when hurricane Harvey and Irma hit us.

How come some of us get killed and get hit with property damages and others don’t? What is the real reason behind these sufferings? How come hurricane Jose goes to the ocean and Harvey and Irma come to our cities?",0,1

4MkC65emkG4,All the celebrities should join together and help the hurricane tragic damages. The people have supported and help them become famous they need to put their money where their mouth is.

4MkC65emkG4,"Look up HAARP my friends, and the real question that these celebrities need to be asking. Why if we have the technology of cloud seeding through laser shooting at particles to create rain and we been manipulating the weather for decades now. Why didn't we redirected or stopped the hurricanes? \n\nEven famous physicists Michio Kaku admits to this geoengenering on a cbs news interview.  \nI wish it didn't happen and all natural disasters are a horrible thing for anyone to endure. And my heart goes out to all the victims and will continue to support. But it is so sad to find out that tragic events like this can be man made at times. So I pray that many of you become aware of what's really taking place in this reality and give your life to God, he won't disappoint you. \nAnd I pray that this whole event about helping is not just an agenda to promote and push coexistence, globalism and unity. Their religion of occult  New Age/mysticism and rise of their Antichrist/alien god to bring their New World Order, which they believe, chaos must be created in order to bring Order. Where with their mind witch powers and advance alien/demon technology they can create  almost anything they can imagine. \nDon't get me wrong please, helping is awesome as I'm praying for everyone including the celebrities participating and even those who have sold their souls for riches and fame, is not to late for redemption! I'm praying for you. But really hope this is not all orchestrated for a different agenda, don't forget that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Time to read our Bibles and take a close look at  the book of Revelation chapter 13,  Daniel 12 and Luke 21.\nStay strong Texas, Florida, all the Caribbean and to all those affected. May you find peace and joy in Christ Jesus even in the middle of the struggles. Remember man and Satan  can only hurt the physical body or the material but can't never have our souls if we believe we are Gods children and the only way to be redeemed and adopted into Gods family is by Jesus Christ our Savior, there's no short cuts and Satan is a liar so don't fall for the lies because religion kills and condemns the soul, only a true relationship with Father God through Jesus saves. God bless 💕",1,5

vu_9muoxT50,"Hello, I am Theresa Williams After being in relationship with Anderson for years, he broke up with me, I did everything possible to bring him back but all was in vain, I wanted him back so much because of the love I have for him, I begged him with everything, I made promises but he refused. I explained my problem to my friend and she suggested that I should rather contact a spell caster that could help me cast a spell to bring him back but I am the type that never believed in spell, I had no choice than to try it, I mailed the spell caster, and he told me there was no problem that everything will be okay before three days, that my ex will return to me before three days, he cast the spell and surprisingly in the second day, it was around 4 pm. My ex called me, I was so surprised, I answered the call and all he said was that he was so sorry for everything that happened that he wanted me to return to him, that he loves me so much. I was so happy and went to him that was how we started living together happily again. Since then, I have made promise that anybody I know that have a relationship problem, I would be of help to such person by referring him or her to the only real and powerful spell caster who helped me with my own problem.

vu_9muoxT50,"Whenever a magician needs to touch something, that's usually where the magic occurs. Unfortunately for Colin, the camera angle right before he asks Heidi to say stop reveals a white item cupped in his right hand (this is of course the magical list of 3 items - Rome/Cheese/Ellen - about to be pressed onto the printed paper wherever she says stop). To see this white item, you'll have to watch the DVR version of the TV broadcast as this internet version has been edited by AGT to remove this reveal. At 03:06, Colin brings this small piece of paper from his right pocket with his right hand. It's all actually a simple slight-of-hand trick performed with far more flair and advance video preparation than wily subterfuge.\n\nAlways be suspicious when a magician needs to touch something with any part of their body or any device they are holding. That's usually where the magic happens.",0,1
vu_9muoxT50,"I liked the trick. Time for kids to tell me I'm a retarded idiot! If you think your so smart then think about this, this is one guy who is trying to entertain you while being pressured by the millions of people to trick them. It's him vs all of the viewers and anybody with half a brain knows every trick has a reveal but that does not make it bad. Also no your 6 year old son did not solve the trick because you are most likely too young to have one.",0,1

vu_9muoxT50,Mel changes her hair like most people change their clothes @_@,0,4
vu_9muoxT50,Yes his trick is obvious. But me personally. I like his presentation. I like how he always starts the presentation with something random (how did he known howie's passcode?) And then they way he talks and the way he looks and how humble he is. And I also like how he's not a singer. He's such a good presenter that when Heidi and simon new what was going on they didn't buzz probably because they didn't want to spoil it for america right when they are so happy and anticipated. \n\nAlso it's pretty impressive that howie ordered a Ellen Burger and just everything that happened was impressive.,0,5
vu_9muoxT50,This is mind blowing. But we all know a singer or a dancer will win,0,5
vu_9muoxT50,He should be the winner,0,5
vu_9muoxT50,THIS MAN IS NOT FROM THIS WORLD DUDE,0,2
vu_9muoxT50,I know how he did it. When he grabbed the paper that Mel picked he had a little piece of paper in his hand it put it over the paper that was grabbed off the table and just made sure his finger was at the spot when they said stop.,0,5
vu_9muoxT50,I noticed he took the paper with his left hand and then for a split second with his right he put something on the paper. It was a small sticker .notice how he kept his right hand on THE paper the whole time?,0,5

vu_9muoxT50,is the best M best on this planet,0,5
vu_9muoxT50,I predict that he will win the show.,0,5
vu_9muoxT50,Simple. Tiny sticker on his finger. He places it when Heidi zeroes in on her chosen area on the card. Look at when its zoomed in. The choices are literally smaller than the size of his fingertip making it easily stickable on the card.,0,4
vu_9muoxT50,Now you see me 3,0,2
vu_9muoxT50,i think he put a sticker or something on the card that mel chose to make it look like she chose ellen rome cheese and heidi was in on it,0,4

vu_9muoxT50,Am i the only one who noticed that he is dressed as Mr. Bean..,0,2

vu_9muoxT50,Can u guys help me get 200 subscribers I'm so close please I'll be so happy,0,5
vu_9muoxT50,I would assume this to be some masterful slight of hand where he slipped the paper from a hidden spot is his sleeve then forced to selection of the tweet on Heide. Much better done than the last time where he made a terrible mistake,0,1

vu_9muoxT50,"I figured it out. At 3:06, after Mel hands him the card, he takes his right hand out of his pocket and puts what I would assume a sticker on there and then forces her to stop on Ellen, Rome, Cheese. Still a fantastic performance!",1,5

vu_9muoxT50,This act wasn't that good... To do the trick he had a sticker in his hand and when Heidi said stop he places the sticker on top of the previous tweet so he already knew it was going to be Ellen Rome Cheese,1,3

1L7JFN7tQLs,"I thought this was a good offering from Apple. It will be a well-executed device and likely be a big winner, sales wise (despite the price) even if they're just now catching up in some areas.  \n\nImpressed by:\n-chipset. They were already beating all competition here with the 7. Bench numbers look amazing and every day performance will likely follow suit. \n\n-software: photo options, UI with no home button looks super easy to adapt to\n\n-4K@60 and slomo. Damn tech is getting impressive across the board here. \n\n-fit and finish and presentation. The package is pleasing to me overall. I don't mind the notch at all. \n\nI was a bit disappointed by a few things:\n\n-screen brightness. Boo! \n-no promotion/120hz refresh\n-fuck 2x optical zoom. Samsung and Apple, get your shit together and give me something more useful here. \n\nI've owned both Apple and various android-based devices. In general, I find Apple to hold up better (lag less) and simply be a more fluid and enjoyable experience. Less buggy, more mainstream/supported and compatible with apps like e.g DJIgo4, etc. \n\nI'll probably wait for the next iteration of this one, but I like it. \n\nWhy has no mentioned the absence of the blush gold color option. That was a winner in my book, but not even a whisper? No one seems to be talking about it, especially after all the leaks.",0,5

1L7JFN7tQLs,Yeah I can’t stand that top bar it’s so goddamn terrible looking!!!!!. For me it’s not about the money price I will be definitely going for the 256 gig. I don’t know if I can leave touch ID. But that top bar I just can’t deal with it watching movies playing games I don’t know what the hell Apple was thinking about leaving the top Bar like that.. And the Face ID I still can’t trust it. There was a video where a guy puts the phone up to an Apple employee’s face and unlocks the phone. Without his permission. So what stop’s the police or anybody trying to Unlock your phone without your permission. I still feel like the face ID has some security flaws..,1,5

UCrBICYM0yM,"How can people be excited about this crap? This makes absolutelly NO sense at all. First: Most catastrophes are not caused by overpopulation, but natural disasters. Even if you make the point of carrying capacity in terms of food becoming a problem, it could be tackled by GMOs easier and better. Second: You CAN NOT just shrink people down like this. The size of nucleons are unalterable, because the ranges of the strong and weak nuclear forces are fundamental constants. Reducing the space between nuclei and electrons is impossible because of electromagnetism. And even packing molecules tighter together wouldn't work, as there'd be biochemical problems. Correct protein folding and therefore enzymes would be rendered impossible. Third: How could they metabolize food and drinks not their own size? Their tiny enzymes wouldn't work on normal-sized molecules. I'd say if you can alter the fundamental universal constants, carrying capacity is no worry any longer, you're basically beyond even a kardashev III civilization by then. \n\nThis isn't even original, as some say. The shrinking trope has been done to death!\nAnd before someone points out this is supposed to be a comedy: Even a comedy needs suspension of disbelief. Also, it may be because I hate Hollywood comedy to the death, but at least for me they're always the same. Clichee-filled crude humor fests with plots of idiocy. And this looks exactly like that.",0,1
UCrBICYM0yM,My first thought was that this looks like a crapy comedy movie but it looks more like a interesting light hearted movie instead. I'm going to keep my eye on it and if it gets decent reviews I'll go to see it.,0,5
UCrBICYM0yM,"Interesting, though now since they are small wouldn't they be further down on the food chain and wild animals, insects and such would most likely kill them?",0,1
UCrBICYM0yM,1:52 Divorce papers. Yeah. That just killed my desire to buy a movie ticket. I'll wait for the Blu-ray instead.,0,1
UCrBICYM0yM,"I love the idea except one thing - INSECTS, THE ANIMAL KINGDOM NO.",0,5
UCrBICYM0yM,"The only remedy to over population is the extermination of areas with excessive birth rates. Places like Africa, the middle East and Asia.",0,4
UCrBICYM0yM,"Wow can't believe I never thought of this for the overpopulation problem I really want to see this movie ,I want to see how this all plays out",0,5
UCrBICYM0yM,Very interesting. Randomly clicked on this and was not disappointed. Can anyone tell me the name of the song?,0,5
UCrBICYM0yM,This is a cute way of getting people on board with voluntary genocide for the betterment of Earth.,0,4
UCrBICYM0yM,You already know I’d set up an underground insect fighting ring and make tons of money.,0,1
UCrBICYM0yM,"I love the concept.  I couldnt help thinking though, what happens when it rains/hails, would it wipe out a city?  What happens if a band of fire ants move in? It will be interesting to see if they address any of the issues they would have.",0,5
UCrBICYM0yM,ant man would be jealous,0,1
UCrBICYM0yM,"If it's got Kristen Wiig in it, then its got me in the cinema. (Also it looks really interesting.)",0,4
UCrBICYM0yM,"Wouldn't it be easier to make the food larger, instead of making everything but the food smaller?",0,1
UCrBICYM0yM,"what about rain, won't it kill them",0,5
UCrBICYM0yM,did his wife failed the shrinking process cause I couldn't see any shrunken version of  her in the trailer,0,1
UCrBICYM0yM,Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart,0,5
UCrBICYM0yM,Why does Matt Damon sound like Owen Wilson in this? Wtf,0,1
UCrBICYM0yM,Saw the thumbnail and thought this looks stupid. Watched the trailer and I'm very intrigued. Good for Paramount to pick up something with a quirky premise :),0,4
UCrBICYM0yM,That's a stupid idea... imagine being attacked by an ant or a cockroach..,0,1
UCrBICYM0yM,I think the whole shrinking process is an inside project orchestrated by the government to kill as many people as possible with efficiency.,0,1
UCrBICYM0yM,Looks great! So what happens top his wife?,0,5
UCrBICYM0yM,i honestly thought this movie was about losing jobs. thumbs up if you did too.,0,4
UCrBICYM0yM,"The document he is signing says defendant, I'm guessing his wife dies getting shrunk and he gets in some legal situation metaphor on little guy against the big guy",0,4
UCrBICYM0yM,"1:34. \n\nLol. That's the first thing a man will check, all okay down there and women would check if both of them are okay up there.",0,4
UCrBICYM0yM,This is like the modern version of honey I shrunk the kids LMAO 😂,0,5
UCrBICYM0yM,I remember... I remember everything... I'm no longer Jason Bourne.,0,1
UCrBICYM0yM,When it is out? 😂,0,4
UCrBICYM0yM,"Isn't population implosion more of a existential crisis facing humanity than over population? I love Matt Damon, wish he'd do sci-fi movies based on real or likely hypothetical situations again. Such as contagion.",0,1
UCrBICYM0yM,Who else watched the trailer like a thousand time?,1,4
UCrBICYM0yM,Great. A film about my downstairs.,2,5
UCrBICYM0yM,"Square Cube Law.. but I don't really care, it is a fun idea of a movie.",1,4

B7YaMkCl3XA,Here it's the real part Cuba get 50% european and 30% Canadian tourist. Not Americans alow in Cuba but yea America it's the only country the world expect to give aid and food to Cuba. How ironic..,0,1
B7YaMkCl3XA,People die all the time...100 died in car wrecks yesterday... I'm dying rite no....w....😫,0,1
B7YaMkCl3XA,just 10? God dammit....step it up nature. at this rate it'll take thousands of years for the humans to go extinct.  gotta upgrade the hurricanes.,0,4
B7YaMkCl3XA,"Best of luck to Cuba. As a south Floridian, I've experienced wilma and now Irma. Both felt identical in damages. Depressing aftermath for both storms but blessed that both were far from catastrophic. Irma was a storm that only hit the Caribbean hard. I can only imagine how bad it is in Cuba right now. Sending my condolences to the lives lost.",0,1

B7YaMkCl3XA,"They created the hurricane so they can push the NEW WORLD ORDER agenda, and destroy thousands of people houses so they wont have access to their homes and will be sent to the camps called FEMA CAMPS and they sound so familiar like they had in WW2 those camps are meant to kill as many people as they can! STAY WOKE GUY, dont be a sheep",0,1

So 10 is a lot even though it seems like nothing here ,it’s a lot for Cubans. And in regards that Cubans barely have any health , medicine or basic living supplies most Cubans die of diabetes and many other diseases and it’s very sad.",0,1
